<!-- An ordered list of the steps of the recipe -->
<ol>
    <li>Lightly grease a 20cm springform pan and line the base and side with baking paper.</li>
    <li>Break up Choc Ripple biscuits into a food processor and process until finely chopped.</li>
    <li>Add butter and process until combined. Transfer to the prepared pan. Use the back of a spoon and/or a straight-sided glass to evenly press the mixture over the base and up the side, stopping about 1cm below the rim. Place in the fridge while you make the filling.</li> 
    <li>Place the cream cheese and sugar in a clean food processor and process until smooth. Add the peppermint essence, cream and enough green food colouring to tint light green. Process, stopping to scrape down the side once or twice, until evenly combined</li>
    <li>Place 2 1/2 tbsp cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle with the gelatine and stir until well combined. Place the bowl inside a larger heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water into the larger bowl until it reaches halfway up the side of the smaller bowl. Set aside, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until the gelatine dissolves.</li>
    <li>Cool, then add to the cream cheese mixture and process until combined. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Reserve 4 Oreos and chop the remaining cookies. Fold chopped Oreos and 1/3 cup choc chips through the cream cheese mixture. Pour into the biscuit case. Coarsely chop the reserved Oreos and sprinkle over the top, with the remaining choc chips. Cover and place in the fridge for about 6 hours or until firm. Serve</li>
